## Introduction

Dusk Lang is an endeavor to create a unique and unconventional language that promotes experimentation and exploration of new programming concepts. The language is implemented with an interpreter in Python to facilitate running and testing code written in this experimental language.

## Installation

To use Dusk and its interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/orlsonjoseph/dusk-lang.git`.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd dusk-lang`.
3. Run the interpreter on any file with the extension `.dusk`

## Usage

To run code written in Dusk, use the following steps:

1. Prepare a source file with code written in Dusk. For example, create a file named `example.dusk`.
2. Invoke the interpreter with the source file as an argument: `python dusk.py example.dusk`.
3. The interpreter will execute the code and provide output or error messages based on the code's execution.

## Contributing

Contributions to Dusk Lang and its interpreter are welcome. If you have ideas for new language features, improvements, or bug fixes, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's collaborate to evolve this experimental language together!
